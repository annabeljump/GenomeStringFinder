1. Make sure you have Java JDK 1.8 installed. If not, please install it (easily found on Oracle's website),
and follow all instructions for the installation.

2. Save the Genome String Finder files on your drive where you would like them.

3. If the Genome String Finder files include ones with .class extensions, skip to step 4, otherwise
open the terminal/console and type cd and then a space before the path to the folder in which you have saved
the Genome String Finder files. Hit Enter. Then, type javac [Filename Here].java (then hit enter) for all .java files.

4. To run the script:
    i) Open the Terminal/Console
    ii) Type cd then a space and the path to the folder in which you have saved the Genome String Finder files
    (then hit enter)
    iii) Type java Main and hit enter, the script should start running.
    If an error occurs, type the following: java -classpath . Main
    (then hit enter) and the script should run.
